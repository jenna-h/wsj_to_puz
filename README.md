# WSJ -> .puz
I wanted to be collaborate with other people on the [Wall Street Journal's Friday Crossword Contests](https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/category/crossword-contest/).

[Down For Across](https://downforacross.com) is a wonderful website which allows people to work on crosswords together in real time! It also has a wonderful feature which allows people to upload .puz files.

So, my challenge was: how can I make a .puz file out of this week's Crossword Contest? I could do it by hand... or I could make my computer do it for me. The latter sounded infinitely superior.

There's a program called [Across Lite](https://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download/), which can make .puz files. You can import a .txt file, formatted according to the [Across Lite Text Format](https://www.litsoft.com/across/docs/AcrossTextFormat.pdf), and then save it as a proper .puz file!

This script is not intended to work for other websites, and it doesn't output a .puz file directly (instead, it outputs a .txt, which has to be imported into Across Lite and subsequently saved). I'm hoping it will be useful anyway. Enjoy~
